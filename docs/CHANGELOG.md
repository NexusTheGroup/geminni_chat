### Changed

- Orchestrator/QC roles migrated from Gemini 2.5 Pro to GPT-5 (via Codex). The orchestrator runs in the IDE and does not make OpenAI API calls from the application.
- Terminology aligned for DeepSeek models:
  - DeepSeek 3.1 — API/chat model for prescriptive coding tasks.
  - DeepThink — high‑reasoning model for complex, code‑centric reasoning.
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, `personas.md`, `prompts.md`, `docs/AI_UTILIZATION_STRATEGY.md`, `README.md`, `docs/ENV.md`.
- **Enhanced AGENTS.md**: Added comprehensive MCP integration section with persona workflow integration and security considerations.
- Clarified example source types in `docs/API_SURFACE.md` and `docs/DB_SCHEMA.sql` to include `deepseek_chat`, `deepthink`, and `grok_chat`.
- Tightened typing + dependency wiring to satisfy Ruff/pytest CI guardrails (FastAPI session deps, ingestion JSON types, search snippet constant, Obsidian export annotations).
