## Testing Quick Start

### Local Testing Environment

The project is configured to run tests without external services (Redis, Celery workers) using mocking and file-based MLflow.

**Environment Variables** (automatically set by test harness):

- `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite test database
- `REDIS_URL`: Mocked (not actually used)
- `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`: File-based tracking (`file://./mlruns`)
- `APP_ENV`: `test`
- `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD`: `1`

**Run Tests Locally**:

```bash
# Using the test harness (recommended)
scripts/test/local.sh

# Or directly with environment setup
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 pytest

# Run specific test modules
scripts/test/local.sh tests/ingestion/test_service.py tests/export/test_obsidian.py
```

**Key Features**:

- Celery tasks are mocked via `mock_celery_tasks` fixture
- MLflow uses file backend by default in tests
- Database uses temporary SQLite with Alembic migrations
- No external service dependencies required
